# TLDR

[TL;DR pages](https://github.com/tldr-pages/tldr/) in Go.

## How to install
With Go, run:
> go install github.com/Pauloo27/tldr@latest

And then create the config at `~/.config/tldr.env` with the following content:
```env
# bs, da, de, es, fr, hbs, hi, id, it, ja, ko, ml, nl, no, pl, pt_BR, pt_PT, ru, sv, ta, th, tr, zh, zh_TW
TLDR_LANG=""
# bat, cat, less, vim, mdcat
TLDR_VIEWER="/usr/bin/less"
```

_You also need to add the Go binary folder to your path, if you haven't done it yet._
_If you don't know where the Go binary folder is, run `go env GOPATH`._

_You can set a language, leave it empty to use English._

_I recommend using mdcat as the viewer_
